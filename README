PiBowl is an automated SVoIP Asterisk installation / configuration script.

http://www.chokepoint.net/2013/08/create-your-own-fish-bowl-nsa-approved.html

It assumes you are using a Debian based system for fetching dependencies.
This was also specifically designed for Raspberry Pi, as the configuration
has low memory compile options enabled by default.

If you require additional modules, you can uncomment the make menuconfig
line in pibowl.sh.

The script will guide you through the entire process, and comes with 
a preconfigured setup. Change the following variables in pibowl.sh in
order to match them to your current VPN setup.

AST_IP=192.168.77.1 # Should be the address Asterisk will bind to.
AST_NAME='PiBowl_Communications' # Organization name used in Asterisk Certificates
ALLOW_CONTACT=192.168.77.0\\/255.255.255.0 # Change me based on your VPN config to only allow local calls
EXTEN=100 	# First client generated will be extension 100

Once you're happy with the settings simply 

$ sudo ./pibowl.sh

You will be prompted periodically for input, mainly when creating a password
for your certificate authority, and while creating certificates for your clients.
You can add as many clients as you want, and it will setup their SIP login
as well as dialing extension for you. You can obviously go back and make
changes / add users as required by using the Asterisk config files.


In the future, we will be adding a client directory for automatically 
configuring a SVoIP client for Raspberry Pi.
